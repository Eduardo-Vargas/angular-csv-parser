# Angular CSV Parser

I have been getting a few quesions on how to process a CSV using only Angular. While Angular might no be the best platform to do this, BehaviorSubjects + services are a way to get around it. If you have any questions, you'll find my contact info once you compile and run this repo - Good luck!

## Prerequisites

This project was generated with

[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.2.

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 8.11.3

Both of these _need to be installed_ before the you follow the instructions below.

## How to run

1. Clone this repo (run `git clone https://github.com/Eduardo-Vargas/angular-csv-parser/` in your terminal)

2. Navigate to the cloned repo (run `cd angular-csv-parser`)

3. Install all dependencies using `npm install`

4. Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. A new tab should open in your default browser but if it doesn't just navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
